    <p id="paragraph"> My favorite hobby is reading books. I enjoy reading because I love learning new stories and random intresting facts. For example, did you know Dhugal Lindsay is a marine researcher who discovered a new type of jellyfish called the Lantern Jellyfish? He also does poetry! My favorite genre is adventure-fiction, or just fiction in general. Though I do read other genres as well. Such as; poetry books, historical fictions, mystery, Greek and Roman mythological fiction, children's litterture, and much more. At 9:00 pm my family and I sit at the dinner table and read for 30 minutes. I also like to go on Webtoon and read online during my free tim (or watch because webtoon consists of comics). Before the pandemic hit I used to go the libaray at my school and ask the librarian for recommendations. I believe that you can learn at least one thing from every book and so you can gain more knowledge while reading for fun.</p>
